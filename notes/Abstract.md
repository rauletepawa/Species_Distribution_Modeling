Understanding how plant communities respond to climate change is essential for biodiversity conservation. We trained a convolutional neural network (ResNet18) to predict alpine plant assemblages in Norway using high-resolution bioclimatic maps (32×32 km patches) from 1991–2018. The model was validated spatially and temporally, and then applied to simulate future species distributions under the RCP8.5 scenario (2061–2080) using HIRHAM5 climate projections. Our approach accurately captured both specialist and generalist species patterns, extrapolating learned ecological signals beyond sampled regions. By comparing current and future predictions, we highlight potential upward shifts in alpine plant distributions and the expansion of treeline species. This deep learning framework offers a scalable tool to assess vegetation responses to climate change across complex landscapes.
