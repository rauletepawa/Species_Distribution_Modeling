# Repository for Masters Thesis Project

### Short description

This project will focus on developing and training DL models, specifically CNNs, to predict the species composition of vascular plant assemblages in Norway using satellite-derived climatic data. We will use species occurrence records from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and associate them with high-resolution climatic variables from sources like CHELSA [(Karger et al., 2021)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?bLQSd8).

### Main Objectives:

#### 1. Develop Deep Learning Models for Species Composition Prediction

- Implement and train CNNs to predict vascular plant assemblage composition in Norway using satellite-derived climate data.
    
- Optimize the model architecture to accurately capture the relationship between climatic variables and species presence across different environmental conditions.
    

#### 2. Enhance Understanding of Climatic Drivers on Plant Assemblages

- Use interpretability techniques to identify and analyze the most influential climatic factors shaping plant assemblages.
    
- Quantify how different climate variables contribute to species composition and assess their ecological significance.
    

#### 3. Predict Species Composition in Undersampled and Future Scenarios

- Utilize the trained models to estimate species compositions in poorly sampled regions of Norway.
    
- Apply future climate projections to forecast changes in vascular plant assemblages under different climate change scenarios.![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfXyCDU5eSdewtWPVPSsQn1I9v7t6puA6U3_CVmqZb82UcCRUEhKGCgBOT-1WEpmqY3BR4qmhNQi25wVvsnP_fopSz0R80nEH3cPLA_Tg5PEj-r4WFymvgG5avomDAf0XMx-ol5?key=RmwAfgQCK3ztacxMBzsRXSzW)

### Using CNN applied to Multi-label classification problems

Building a Species Distribution Model (SDM) that interprets climatic maps to predict  vegetation plots compsition can be done by applying [Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)](https://medium.com/thedeephub/convolutional-neural-networks-a-comprehensive-guide-5cc0b5eae175) to a [multilabel-classification](https://medium.com/data-science-in-your-pocket/multi-label-classification-for-beginners-with-codes-6b098cc76f99). 

Vegetation plots can be encoded as binary vectors where 0 corresponds to absence and 1 corresponds to presence. Thus if we have encoded in a fixed position all the 1819 plant species in norway, we can represent the present and absent species in a determinated area using a binary vector of 1819 variables.

**Species composition vector example:**

As you can see, we have multiple 0 (absent species) and multiple 1 (present species). 
In the same vegetation plot we can have many present species (many 1 values) in the species composition vector.
In a multilabel classification we can have many correct instances (present species) for a single sample. So this kind of classification approach perfectly suits our problem!!

#### Dataset

We used an [Rscript](https://github.com/rauletepawa/Species_Distribution_Modeling/blob/main/code/1_gbif_norge_data.R) to download all the GBIF occurrences in vascular plants in Norway main land from 1991 to 2020. We applied some filters to remove all those occurrences located in capitals, institutions, seas or that did not have any valid coordinates assigned inside Norway.

Then we obtained a occurrence clean dataset 

The dataset is composed by a total of 59.074 vegetation plots collected from 1991 until 2018. For each vegetation plot coordinates (location) I extracted a 11 channels (variables) 32x32 climatic map at 1km resolution (1 pixel corresponds to 1km). All the samples were carefully filtered through geospatial analysis to
